This directory contains the FULL version of Ken's Labyrinth!

Ken's Labyrinth shareware was first released to the world on January 1, 1993.
In March, 1993, an improved shareware version under the Epic MegaGames label
was released.

On November 16, 1999, I, Ken Silverman, with permission from Epic MegaGames,
decided to release the full version of Ken's Labyrinth for free.  This is due
to the fact that Epic MegaGames no longer sells its older titles, which
includes Ken's Labyrinth.  You may copy this software freely.

All I ask is that you follow these simple guidelines:

1) This software can not be sold for profit in any way.

2) When distributing, please do not remove any files that came with this
	original archive.  This includes all text files.

3) Ignore the order information - you already have the full version if you're
   reading this!  Also many of the phone numbers and addresses (excluding
   this README.TXT file) are out of date.

4) The last time I compiled this code was in 1993 - it's ancient history to
	me.  You should look at this as a piece of history as well.  In no way is
	this software meant to be representative of my current work or remotely
	competetive with today's current games.

5) I will NOT provide any support for this game.  I know there are some bugs.
	For example, these bugs are all caused by newer hardware:

   * Sound Blaster sound effects will likely crash the computer.  If you have
       a relatively new computer, consider yourself lucky if it works.

   * Doors flip open and closed at a very fast rate.  Keep whapping at the
       space bar.  Eventually the door will end up in the open state.

   * After pressing 'A' or 'Z', you get stuck at the ceiling or floor.  If
       you like being in the center, simply don't use these keys.

   Since I have no plans of fixing these bugs, you will just have to deal
   with them in the best way that you can.

Any new information about Ken's Labyrinth will be posted at my web site:

P.S. As a special bonus, I have included 3 save games which will bring you
straight to the ending sequences of all 3 episodes and another one which
shows you what winning the jackpot at the slot machine is like.  Enjoy!
