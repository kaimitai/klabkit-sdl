These folders contain the original game data files for boards and tile graphics for the official versions of Ken's Labyrinth: 2.1, 2.0, 1.1, 1.0 (and the tech demo Walken).

Ken Silverman's home page is located at http://advsys.net/ken, and these files, as well as the rest of the game files, can be found on The official Ken's Labyrinth page at http://advsys.net/ken/klab.htm

The boards and graphics were made by Ken Silverman and Andy Cotter. Mikko Iho, a member ("Pixel") of Future Crew (who made the famous "Second Reality" demo) did some graphics for v2.x.
