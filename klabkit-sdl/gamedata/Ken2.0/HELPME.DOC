                      ** KEN'S LABYRINTH **

ABOUT THE GAME:

Ken's Labyrinth is a 3D arcade game featuring high-res 256-color graphics,
music,  and digital sound effects.  Ken's Labyrinth consists of three episodes:

     1. The Search for Sparky
     2. Sparky's Revenge
     3. Find the Way Home

Requirements:
     þ IBM AT-Compatible computer (386 or 486 highly recommended)
     þ VGA Graphics
     þ 512K of total memory (at least 365K available)
     þ About 1 megabyte of hard disk space

Also supports:
     þ EMS and XMS memory support (for faster play)
     þ Joystick or Gravis Gamepad for control
     þ Mouse
     þ Sound Blaster or Adlib card (great music!)


   HOW TO START
   ============

Before playing,  you need to run SETUP to tell the game what hardware you
have.  Simply type "SETUP",  and go through the menu choices and select your
hardware from the lists of choices.

Note:  If you play the game without running SETUP,  it should work fine,  but
       you'll miss the music,  sound effects,  and high-res graphics.

Once you've run SETUP once,  you'll be able to start playing.  Type "KEN" to
begin.  If the game does not start properly,  you probably have given an
incorrect piece of information in the SETUP program,  so type SETUP again to
remedy this.


   TROUBLE SHOOTING
   ================

IF THE SCREEN IS GARBLED:  Go into setup and set the graphics mode to 1.  This
   mode should work properly on all video cards.

WINDOWS & OS/2:  If you take a few precautions,  this game should work properly
   from Windows and OS/2.  To make it work,  we suggest that you do the
   following in SETUP:

   * If you don't have a music card, turn sound effects OFF.  The method this
     game uses to generate sound will probably crash under Windows and OS/2.

   * Set the graphics mode to 1.

IF THE GAME DOESN'T FUNCTION PROPERLY:  This game may be conflicting with some
   of the TSR's and memory managers you have in memory.  We suggest removing
   the TSR's and memory managers from your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files
   and trying again.  Or,  create a boot disk and start Ken's Labyrinth from
   the boot disk.

NOTE TO OWNERS OF "STACKER" AND "SUPERSTOR":  If this game does not work
   properly on a compressed hard disk volume,  we recommend installing it on
   a non-compressed drive (usually referred to as D:, E:, or F:).  See your
   Stacker or SuperStor manual for instructions on doing this.


   THE STORY
   =========

   The fate of the Planet Earth is in your hands. The scientific
community on the planet Zogar has been searching the universe for the
alien races capable of providing them with worthy entertainment. Of
course, their entertainment consists of placing specimens from
alien races together into a dangerous labyrinth. Some have been
extremely intelligent, but were lacking in physical skills. Others
were great warriors but lacked the intelligence needed to solve the
clever traps invented by the Zogarians. In an attempt to keep
the universe clean, the planets containing races whose specimens
could not solve the labyrinth have had their molecular structure
reconfigured into coal that fuels the stoves which make red jelly
that Zogarians love on their bagels and toast. The Zogarians are led by
an infinitely evil (and ugly) creature simply named "Ken". You'll
find out more about him in episode three.

   By cover of night the Zogarians traveled to earth and picked up a
representative of Earth's most intelligent beings. So, now they've
got your dog Sparky. After thorough interrogation of Sparky, the
Zogarians found out that dogs, in addition to being great companions,
are the universe's most highly intelligent beings and have been
conducting experiments on humans for years. While most of those
experiments consisted of things like convincing humans to throw
balls to them over and over again, the Zogarians nonetheless became
fearful of canine intelligence. Instead of testing Sparky, who is
obviously smart enough to escape their traps, they decided it would
be safer for them to merely lock him up and get his human "master"
for their experiments. Of course, that's you, isn't it? Now, they've
secretly brought you to Zogar and you're being tested on behalf of
the whole human race. You will be judged by your performance in the
danger-filled labyrinth. So far, 26 civilizations have been tested in
the labyrinth, and 26 planets have become fuel for the jelly makers.
In addition to having the fate of your planet in your hands, you
probably should also "Search for Sparky" while you're here because
you'll need him to finish the game. By the way, on top of the labyrinth
is the spectators' box, where the leaders of the Zogar Imperial
Empire have been watching and they may sometimes shout insults down at
you.

   THINGS YOU'LL FIND IN KEN'S LABYRINTH
   =====================================

   OBJECTS THAT HELP YOU:

      Bullets - You can get up to six bullet powers of each kind of bullet.
        The more bullet powers you have, the more often you can shoot.

      Red jelly (red) - Just a simple straight-flying bullet.

      Bouncy bullets (fireballs) - These bullets bounce off all walls
         that you cannot normally walk through.

      Heat Seeking Missiles - They seek out and destroy the enemies on the
         screen; some enemies generate more heat than others and will attract
         the missiles better.  The missiles also hit with double power.

      Lightnings - You can get up to six lightnings.  The more lightnings
         you have, the farther each bullet will travel.

      Extra Lives - You can get up to 4 extra lives.  When you die, the floor
         does NOT reset.  However you do go back to the starting position.
         If you have no extra lives when you die, the game is over!

      Keys - There both gold and silver keys.  The gold key unlocks gold doors,
         and the silver key unlocks silver doors!  Both disappear after each
         level is completed.

      Life bar - Near the top of the status bar there is a red life bar; if
         the whole bar is red you are perfectly healthy.  When the
         bar turns completely white, you die.

      Apple - Gives you some life.

      Meals (meat and a glass) - Gives twice as much life as apples.

      First-aid kits - Gives twice as much life as meals.

      Coins - You can put these in soda or slot machines for a reward.

      Gems - Worth several coins each.

      Soda Machines - Scattered around various boards.  After inserting a
         coin by pressing space bar next to one, you can pick and choose
         an object to buy.  It may be wise to save up coins for the
         more powerful items.

      Slot Machines - Scattered around various boards.  After inserting a
         coin by pressing space bar next to one, you may get 1 to 200 coins
         if you win; but if you lose, tough luck.

      Magical items - These items last for about 30 seconds, then they
         disappear.  If you have two of the same type of magical item
         at the same time, then you will have 60 seconds of use, for
         three - 90 seconds of use, etc.

      Purple potions - Hits monsters with more power every time they are
         shot, allows red and orange bullets to pass through walls
         that you can't walk through and reduces the damage you take.

      Green potions - Reflects enemy bullets back at the enemy, damaging
         them as one of your red bullets would.

      Gray cloak - Enemies and their bullets pass right through you.  The
         only way to die with these is to fall down a hole.

      Blue cloak - Enemies shrivel up and die upon your contact with
         them when you are wearing this cloak.


A FEW QUICK HINTS
=================

* Save the game often!  Then,  when you get zapped,  you can easily load it
  back and continue from where you were previously.

* Avoid the FANS.   They quickly eat away at your life if you stand in them.

* Don't walk into the holes,  especially the moving holes with the red eyes.

* The 8-Balls are virtually impossible to shoot down.  Your best bet for
  destroying them is to lead them into holes.

* Frozen Ghosts - There are only two ways to destroy these beasts.  One is by
  a hole, and the other - well you can figure it out.

* Walking holes (holes with eyes in them) - Bullets pass right over them.  The
  only way to destroy these critters is by leading them into a permanent hole.
  (In other words, the only way to destroy a hole is to have the hole fall
  down a hole)

* Zorko - Repels heat-seekers and shoots fireballs almost constantly.

* Other bosses - The final challenge!  Nobody knows who they are or what they
  look like.  All that we know is that to succeed in your mission, they must
  be destroyed.  They are the bosses of levels 20 and 30.
