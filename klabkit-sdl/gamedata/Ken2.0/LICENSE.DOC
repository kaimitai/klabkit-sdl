                           LICENSING AGREEMENT

This file, LICENSE.DOC, describes the only terms by which Epic MegaGames
permits the Commercial Distribution of this program throughout the world.

"Commercially distribute" means to distribute for money or other
consideration.  It includes copying onto magnetic disks, CD-Roms
or any other tangible medium now or subsequently known, and
distribution by retail rack, direct mail, catalog, advertisement,
or trade show.  It does *not* include distribution by any not-
for-profit organization, by any hobby, user or computer interest
group to its members, or electronically by any BBS.

"Program" means this Version and its related files (including this one)
distributed by us under the marks "KEN'S LABYRINTH" and "EPIC MEGAGAMES"
(collectively, the "Trademark"), as it may be upgraded or otherwise modified
from time to time.

A. OWNERSHIP:  Except to the extent expressly licensed by us, we
have and reserve the exclusive copyright and other right, title
and interest to distribute the Program and all earlier versions
of it, and the right to use the Trademark in connection with them.

B. CURRENT VERSION:  As from the March 21, 1993 all previous versions of
    this program have been withdrawn from shareware. This version is the only
    official release version,  and it replaces any previous versions.

C. YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES:  You may Commercially Distribute the Program under
   this License so long as you:

[1]  Market it as shareware using "try before you buy" or similar words,
     to assure that your customers clearly understand the shareware concept.

[2]  Sell only the most current version of it.

[3]  Distribute the complete Program including all of its related files.
     You may *not* modify or remove any files,  including all program and
     data files,  and all documentation,  including VENDOR.DOC, LICENSE.DOC,
     ORDER.DOC, and CATALOG.EXE.

[4]  Include the word "Epic MegaGames" in every description of the
     Program used in your catalog or other promotional material.

[5]  IF YOU DISTRIBUTE BY "RACK" or otherwise allow the Program
     to be sold in a retail establishment:

     [a]  The word SHAREWARE  and the full Shareware Concept must be
          prominently displayed on the exterior of each Racked Package.

     [b]  You  must  inform  the   Retailer   that  he   will  be
          distributing Shareware Products and *NOT* "Low Cost Software".
          You  must  also  inform the Retailer of the full Shareware
          Concept.

     [c]  Under  NO  circumstances  can  this program be added to
          another  to form part of a disk, or be used to form any
          Compendium  Pack or any other "Special Offer Package"
          without written permission  being  first  obtained from
          an authorized Epic MegaGames agent.

     [d]  We require that you pay us a royalty of 10 cents per
          copy sold after the first 100 (which may be sold
          royalty-free).  This royalty is payable quarterly.

     [e]  We reserve the right, in our discretion, to waive or
          reduce the royalty in the cases of rack vendors who
          voluntarily:

          [i]   Report customer comments regarding the Program,
                including compliments, reports of bugs, and feature
                requests; or

          [ii]  Promote the Program by advertisements or prominent
                displays; or

          [iii] Provide other proper services.

[6]  SPECIAL UNITED KINGDOM REQUIREMENTS:  To Commercially Distribute this
     software in the UNITED KINGDOM,  you must follow these additional terms:

          files,  each  in  compressed  or other format AS RELEASED BY

          to be sold in a retail establishment,  we require that you pay
          PRECISION SOFTWARE PUBLISHING a royalty of 10 pence per copy
          sold.  This royalty takes the place of any royalties due directly
          to Epic MegaGames.  This will be done by pre-purchasing coded
          labels which are to be displayed on any Rack Packs at all times.
          This royalty is to help Police the  Rack  vending  sector
          of  the  Market, and ultimately protect the professional

notice, you may  distribute  the  Program  until the earlier of 30 days
after the termination  date in  the  notice, or completion of the
distribution of the  copies you  have in stock.  Sections A, D and F
